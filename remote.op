git remote command will let you take local repository change synchronously
to the remote repository.

Assume that you have an repository on github, the address will like:
git@github.com:yuezy3/hello-world.git    //using ssh key to access
or:
https://github.com/yuezy3/hello-world.git
if you take the ".git" part off the url above, then you just got the address of
your repository, access it in browser to see it.

To push or pull data from an remote repository, first you need to set the remote
repository's name and address ï¼ˆ which make sense because you need let
git to know where to find the repository)

Using command:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yuezy3/hello-world.git
in which, origin is an name you give to the repository.

using command:
git remote -v
to list all the repository locally recognized.

To push local repository to remote server, using:
git push -u origin master
origin is the name, and master is local branch. "-u" here will let you
do "git push" next time without "origin master" part.

git remote rm <name>  // remove name
git pull             // reverse to get push.


Donnot run those command after push:
git reset --soft HEAD^
git commit --amend -m "new commit message"
git reset --hard HEAD^
git reset --hard HEAD^^
Because this will change history.
